            <h3>World</h3>
            <p><em>Dune</em>'s story is solid, and the world Herbert created 
                is one that I think will stick with me for a very long 
                time. The lore of this world and thorough and fascinating,
                and the journey taken by Paul Atreides throughout the novel is one
                that I will remember.

            <p>A complaint I and many others seem to have about this book 
                is that from its first few chapters, you are thrown into
                the deep end; there are a lot of concepts and terminology
                that you are exposed to in the beginning, making it
                difficult to immerse oneself in this world due to the 
                amount of information you are given all at once. Once you
                turn the final page, however, you are likely to find that it was
                worth it to push through that initial learning curve.

            <h3>Character</h3>
            <p>
                Each major character of the novel is well-developed, and they each play
                important parts in the larger story. Aside from the main character, Paul,
                there is his father, Duke Leto, a man who has been tasked with leading
                his house and family on a mission to a dangerous planet by order of the
                emporer. He does his best with the hand he's been dealt, and when all 
                seems lost, he manages to sacrifice his life for the good of his people.

                Lady Jessica is Paul's mother and a member of the myserious group known
                as the Bene Gesserit. She must constantly balance her duty to the Bene
                Gesserit and her family. Throughout the novel, she shows strength and 
                wisdom on her travels with Paul through the desert.
