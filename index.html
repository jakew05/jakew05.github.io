                <h3>Overall thoughts:</h3>
                    <p><em>Dune</em>'s story is solid, and the world Herbert created 
                        is one that I think will stick with me for a very long <br>
                        time. The lore of this world is thorough and fascinating,
                        and the journey taken by Paul Atreides throughout the novel is one<br>
                        that I will remember.
                    </p>
                    <p>A complaint I and many others seem to have about this book 
                        is that from its first few chapters, you are thrown into<br>
                        the deep end; there are a lot of concepts and terminology
                        that you are exposed to in the beginning, making it<br>
                        difficult to immerse oneself in this world due to the 
                        amount of information you are given all at once. Once you<br>
                        turn the final page, however, you are likely to find that it was
                        worth it to push through that initial learning curve.
